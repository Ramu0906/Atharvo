This project aims to predict whether a student is "Placed" or "Not Placed" based on various features such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, and personal details. The dataset used includes features like ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, Gender, Part-Time Job, Absence Days, Extracurricular Activities, Weekly Self-Study Hours, Career Aspiration, and various subject scores (Math, History, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, and Geography). The target variable is Placement, which can be either "Placed" or "Not Placed." The project leverages machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify students' placement status. It provides a web interface where users can upload a CSV file containing student data, and the system predicts whether each student will be placed. The trained models are saved in .pkl format and loaded in the Flask-based web application to perform the predictions. Additional features, such as real-time predictions and enhanced data visualization, may be added in future updates.
